# meteor-todos

Simple app following along with [Meteor's todo app tutorial](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/blaze/creating-an-app).

I just did what they said to do in the app, changing only the errors thrown by the Meteor methods since they weren't very descriptive.

To run the app, you'll have to [install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install). Then, you can clone the repo, and within the directory run `meteor` and it will be live at `localhost:3000`!

This app is also deployed at http://jn_simple_todo.meteor.com.
